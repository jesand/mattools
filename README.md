===============

Linear algebraic tools for Go, based on the excellent NumPy library for Python.

Project Status
---------------

This project is in very early stages of development, and a strong argument could
be made for merging its unique features into another library, such as
https://github.com/gonum/matrix. However, I would like to add more of the
features from NumPy and SciPy to build this into a more robust scientific
computing framework. Any comments are welcome.

Documentation
---------------

You can find API documentation at [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jesand/numgo/matrix)
